 your existing dashboard design?

help me to now on real i want to code it ....  remember all colum as on excel so that When export i can get all this ...

I'll help you implement the complete big data upload system for your Laravel application. Let me start by creating the necessary database migrations, models, and controllers to handle your diamond data with all 26 columns.

Database Migration - Create Upload Tables
Code 
Now let me create the models and controllers:

Models - Upload, DiamondData, UploadChunk, UploadError
Code 
Now let me create the controller and upload handling logic:

BigData Upload Controller
Code 
Now let me create the queue jobs for processing:

Queue Jobs - ProcessUploadJob, ProcessChunkJob
Code 
Continue

Queue Jobs - ProcessUploadJob, ProcessChunkJob
Code ∙ Version 2 
Now let me create the blade templates for the upload interface that matches your dashboard design:

Upload Blade Views - Upload Form & Data Display
Code 
Now let me create the data display view with filtering and search capabilities:

Data Display View - Index with Filters & Search
Code 
Continue

Data Display View - Index with Filters & Search
Code ∙ Version 2 
Continue

Data Display View - Index with Filters & Search
Code ∙ Version 3 
Now let me create the routes and additional controller methods to complete the system:

Routes & Additional Controller Methods
Code 
Now let me create the final pieces - the service class for handling the complex processing logic and update your layout navigation:

Upload Service & Navigation Update
Code 
Now let me create the final configuration and command files to complete your implementation:

Final Setup - Commands & Configuration
Code 
Perfect! I've created a complete big data upload system for your Laravel application. Here's what you now have:

Complete Implementation Summary
Database Structure - Four new tables (uploads, upload_chunks, upload_errors, diamond_data) with proper indexing for your 100K+ diamond records with all 26 columns preserved exactly as in your CSV.

Queue-Based Processing - Master job splits your CSV into 2,000-row chunks, processes them in parallel using Redis queues, preventing timeouts and memory issues.

Real-Time Progress Tracking - Users see live updates during processing with chunk-by-chunk progress, error counts, and completion estimates.

Advanced Filtering & Search - Filter by cut, color, clarity, carat weight ranges, price ranges, lab certification, plus full-text search across multiple fields.

Excel Export - Complete export functionality that maintains all 26 columns with proper formatting and handles large datasets efficiently.

Professional UI Integration - Matches your existing dashboard design perfectly with the same rounded-3xl cards, green color scheme, and responsive layout.

Key Performance Features
Memory Optimization - Processes files in small chunks, uses batch insertions, and implements proper garbage collection.

Timeout Prevention - Long-running operations happen in background queues with configurable timeouts and retry logic.

Error Handling - Comprehensive error logging with row-level error tracking and validation failure details.

Database Performance - Strategic indexing on filterable columns, efficient upsert operations, and optimized query patterns.

Next Steps to Deploy
Install Dependencies: Run composer require maatwebsite/excel league/csv predis/predis
Run Migrations: Execute php artisan migrate to create the tables
Configure Redis: Set up Redis for queue processing and update your .env file
Update Navigation: Replace the disabled "Upload BigData" nav item with the active link to route('bigdata.index')
Start Queue Workers: Run php artisan queue:work --queue=bigdata --timeout=600 to process uploads
Test with Sample: Upload your 100K diamond CSV to verify everything works correctly
The system handles all your requirements: efficient large file uploads, real-time progress tracking, comprehensive filtering and search, detailed data display, and Excel export with all columns preserved. It's designed to scale and handle even larger datasets while maintaining excellent performance.

Would you like me to create any additional components, such as email notifications for completed uploads or admin monitoring tools?
